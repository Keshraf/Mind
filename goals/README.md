### Growth

Through this initiative, we plan to not only help an individual cope with the losses suffered due to the pandemic but also allow the individual to grow as a person. Our methodology aims to personally grow the individual in both their personal and professional life.

### Safety

We are a very inclusive community that aims to cater for a large number of people from various ethnicities and minorities. All our members and staff are made to sign an agreement that has zero tolerance for abusive behaviour. Our counsellor ensures a safe environment during every meeting so that the individuals can be open and honest.

### Health

Although our main goal is to improve the minds of our members, we believe that a healthy body can be a great asset in this competitive world. A healthy body can channel the required energy to allow its host to complete all of their tasks efficiently.
